============================================
 Simple PV simulation and network streaming
============================================

As a simple PV simulation test case, we provide two separate shell utilities, which might want to be packaged separately, but lets keep it simple.

Installation
------------
is handled by ``pipenv``.```

```shell
pipenv install --deploy
```

A [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com/) server -- to be used as broker -- is expected to run at AMQP_URL (defaulting to ```localhost:?```).

metersim
--------

``metersim`` connects to the broker and publishes the current demand (drawn from a Uniform distribution $\mathcal U([0, 60])$) and maybe a timestamp?

Usage
~~~~~

``metersim`` is available as an entrypoint. Run with ``metersim``.

pvsim
-----

``pvsim`` connects to the broker and subscribes to its demand topic for receiving real time (stamped?) electricity load measurements by the meter (it infinitely tries to re-establish the connection if it is interrupted (must be non-blocking)).

Each second it computes a simulated photovoltaic generation value.

``Time``, ``Meter``, ``PV`` and ``Residual load`` is written to a CSV file. With ``NaN``s for ``Meter`` and ``Residual load`` if the connection between ``meter`` and ``pvsim`` is interrupted.

Usage
~~~~~

``pvsim`` is available as an entrypoint, as well, and can be run with ``pvsim``.

.. note:: We might want to add a separate entrypoint or command line argument to ``pvsim`` for updating the shape parameter definition file (specifying different years, lat/lon coordinates) and/or switching to another one.
